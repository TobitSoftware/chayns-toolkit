**chayns-scripts** contains pre-configured tools for the development, publishing
and testing of your app. It was created to simplify the development experience
when working with [React](https://reactjs.org).

> This toolchain is specialized in developing apps for the
> [chaynsÂ®](https://chayns.org/) platform. If you want to develop a general
> purpose web app, take a look at [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or
> [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/)

## Get Started

First install the `chayns-scripts` package in your project:

```bash
yarn add chayns-scripts -D
```

or

```bash
npm i chayns-scripts -D
```

The package provides the following commands:

-   `chayns-scripts dev`
-   `chayns-scripts build`
-   `chayns-scripts lint`

We recommend adding these to the scripts section of your package.json:

```json
{
    "...": "",
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "chayns-scripts dev",
        "build": "chayns-scripts build",
        "lint": "chayns-scripts lint"
    },
    "...": ""
}
```

Your project will have two entry points. An `index.html` files in the `src/`
directory at the root of your project will be the entry point for visitors.

A JavaScript/TypeScript file in the `src/` directory with one of the following
names will be the entry point for your bundle:

-   `index.js`
-   `index.jsx`
-   `index.ts`
-   `index.tsx`

> To use TypeScript, you need a `tsconfig.json`.
> [Read more](#typescript-support)

Your project structure should look similar to this:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MyComponent.jsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.jsx
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore
```

An example project can be found
[here](https://github.com/leodr/chayns-scripts/tree/master/packages/example-project).

### Linting

We also provide an [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)-configuration that works with
JavaScript and TypeScript. To activate linting, install ESLint first:

```bash
yarn add eslint -D
```

or

```bash
npm i eslint -D
```

Then add a `eslintConfig` key to your `package.json` like that:

```json
{
    "...": "",
    "eslintConfig": {
        "extends": "@chayns-scripts"
    },
    "...": ""
}
```

For integration into your editor check out the official
[Integrations page](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors).

## Commands

### `chayns-scripts dev`

Starts the local development server on
[`https://0.0.0.0:1234/`](https://0.0.0.0:1234/) if SSL was configured,
otherwise it will use [`https://localhost:1234/`](https://localhost:1234/).

You can configure the host, port and SSL settings in a `chayns-scripts.json`
configuration file:

```json
{
    "host": "123.0.0.1",
    "port": 1337,
    "https": {
        "cert": "path-to-cert",
        "key": "path-to-key"
    }
}
```

> To achieve faster builds and rebuilds this command only transpiles your code
> to work with the latest versions of Google Chrome, Safari and Firefox.

### `chayns-scripts build`

Builds your source code for production. The assets will be emitted into the
`build/` directory in your project root.

It will transpile your code to work with browsers matching the following
[browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) configuration:

```
>0.5%
not dead
not op_mini all
```

| Parameters        | Function                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-a`, `--analyze` | Analyze your bundle with [`webpack-bundle-analyzer`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer) after the build is complete. |

### `chayns-scripts lint`

Lints your JavaScript and TypeScript source code with
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and reports any errors, automatically fixing them
if possible.

We recommend to use our included [ESLint configuration](#eslint-configuration).

### TypeScript Support

TypeScript is supported by default and we encourage to use it.

#### Getting Started

To start using TypeScript in your project, create a `tsconfig.json` file in the
root of your project and start the `chayns-scripts dev` command. Your
`tsconfig.json` will automatically be filled our recommended configuration.

> If you do not have a `tsconfig.json` file and use `.ts` or `.tsx` files,
> ESLint will not be able to check these for errors.

#### Caveats

The TypeScript compilation is done by
[`@babel/preset-typescript`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-typescript).
This has some caveats, mainly not beeing able to use `const enum` and `export =`
or `import =`.

The automatically generated `tsconfig.json` includes `"isolatedModules": true`
in the TypeScript compiler options, which will make the TypeScript compiler warn
you when using unsupported features.

Refer to the
[Babel documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-typescript#caveats)
for more information.

### (S)CSS Support

You can import `.css` and `.scss` files by default:

```js
import "./my-styles.scss"
```

#### CSS Modules

CSS modules are also supported. Every file ending with `.module.css` or
`.module.scss` will be treated as a module, to be used like this:

```jsx
import styles from "styles.css"

export function MyComponent() {
    return <div className={styles.box}>I am styled with CSS modules!</div>
}
```

> This is the preferred way to use CSS in your projects. For more information on
> CSS Modules check out
> [this article](https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/).

### Image Assets

Images with `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg` or `.gif` extensions can be imported into
your components and will be automatically be included in the bundle. An image
modules default export will be it's final url:

```jsx
import imgSrc from "./my-image.png"

export function MyImage() {
    return <img src={imgSrc} alt="" />
}
```

> Small images (< 8 KB) will be inlined into the JavaScript code with data-urls
> and therefore won't appear as files next to your bundled code. This improves
> loading times of small images.

#### SVG Support

Importing `.svg` files will automatically make them available as React
components:

```jsx
import Icon from "./my-icon.svg"

export function MyIcon() {
    return <Icon />
}
```

### HMR With [`react-refresh`](https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin) Support

The development server supports hot module reloading with `react-refresh` (the
improved alternative to the now deprecated `react-hot-loader`).

This allows you to see changes in your React components instantly after saving
without losing component state. Some patterns are unsupported, for further
information refer to
[this paragraph](https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin#caveats).

### ESLint Configuration

Our ESLint-config `@chayns-scripts/eslint-config`) is automatically included
when `chayns-scripts` is installed.

To activate the config add an `eslintConfig` key to your `package.json`:

```json
{
    "...": "",
    "eslintConfig": {
        "extends": "@chayns-scripts"
    },
    "...": ""
}
```

or use one of the
[other options for configuring ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#using-configuration-files-1).

The configuration can be installed as a standalone package
(`@chayns-scripts/eslint-config`).

> Personal note: These rules exist for a reason. They extend the
> [AirBnB JavaScript Guidelines](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and
> should be taken seriously, especially the accessibility rules are disregarded
> way too often ðŸ˜¶. Pay attention to your linter and use disabling-comments
> sparingly.

If you think that a rule should be adjusted, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/leodr/chayns-scripts/issues/new) to discuss
the suggested change instead of adjusting your local configuration.

### Analyzing Your Bundle

By passing the `--analyze` flag to `chayns-scripts build` you can use
[`webpack-bundle-analyzer`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer)
to investigate your bundle-size. It will automatically open the tree-map of your
bundled files after compiling. This will run as long as you keep the terminal
process alive.

### Tree-Shaking for [chayns-components](https://github.com/TobitSoftware/chayns-components)

The tree-shaking for chayns-components is built into the build configuration and
configured automatically. For further information refer to
[this document](https://github.com/TobitSoftware/chayns-components/blob/master/tree-shaking.md).

If your bundle size is unexpectedly large, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/leodr/chayns-scripts/issues/new).

### The `chayns-scripts.json` Configuration File

A `chayns-scripts.json` file in the root of your projects is used to configure
certain aspects of the scripts (but is not required).

Example `chayns-scripts.json`:

```json
{
    "host": "123.0.0.1",
    "port": 1337,
    "https": {
        "cert": "//path/to/ssl/cert",
        "key": "//path/to/ssl/key"
    }
}
```

The following options are supported:

| Option      | Type                             | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`host`**  | `string`                         | This configures the hostname for your dev server (used by `chayns-scripts dev`). Will default to `localhost` without SSL certificates or `0.0.0.0` when SSL certificates are provided. |
| **`port`**  | `number`                         | This sets the port for your dev server. Defaults to `1234`.                                                                                                                            |
| **`https`** | `{ cert: string; key: string; }` | This option configures SSL certificates to be used during development. `cert` and `key` have to be paths to the corresponding `.crt` and `.key` files.                                 |

## Notes on Multiple Entrypoints

Some projects use multiple webpack entrypoints for different outputs to reduce
configuration duplication. Since this is already the purpose of this repository,
a project with multiple entrypoints doesn't seem to make much sense.

Therefore we do not support multiple entrypoints. If you have projects that are
related and you want them to be in the same repository, use a
[monorepo](https://www.toptal.com/front-end/guide-to-monorepos).
