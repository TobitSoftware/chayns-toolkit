These options configure the build output generated by `chayns-toolkit build`.

All options aswell as the `toolkit.config.js` file itself are optional.

```js
// toolkit.config.js

module.exports = {
    output: {
        /**
         * Toggles single-file build functionality. Read more below
         *
         * @type {boolean}
         */
        singleBundle: false,

        /**
         * Change the file-name your of primary output bundle. You can use any
         * of the [webpack substitutions](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#template-strings)
         * as well as the `[package]` substitution, which will be replaced by
         * the package name specified in your `package.json`. Defaults to
         * `[package].[contenthash].js`.
         *
         * @type {string}
         */
        filename: "[package].[contenthash].js",

        /**
         * Set an absolute path where your output will be emitted to.
         *
         * @type {string}
         */
        path: "//my-qa-server/example-project",
    },
    // ... other options ...
}
```

## Single File Builds

In single-file build mode, the compiler will inline all assets (CSS, images,
etc.) together with all JavaScript into a single bundle. This can be useful when
building smaller fragments of a UI, e.g. some kind of plugin.
