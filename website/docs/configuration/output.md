These options configure the build output generated by `chayns-toolkit build`.

All options aswell as the `toolkit.config.js` file itself are optional.

```js title="/toolkit.config.js"

        singleBundle: false,

## Single File Builds

In single-file build mode, the compiler will inline all assets (CSS, images, etc.) together with all
JavaScript into a single bundle. This can be useful when building smaller fragments of a UI, e.g.
some kind of plugin.
